# Raspberry Pi Learning Repository - CS1602

## 📖 Description  
This repository is derived from the **CS1602** course and contains source code examples, project files, and learning guides documenting my hands‑on experience with the **Raspberry Pi 5 (4 GB RAM)**. The materials cover a range of embedded and IoT topics, including GPIO control, sensor interfacing, communication protocols, and system setup—intended to support self‑paced learning and experimentation.

## 🖥️ Hardware Specifications  
- **Board**: Raspberry Pi 5 (4 GB RAM)  
- **OS**: Raspberry Pi OS (latest recommended)  
- **Key Peripherals Used**: May not needed in this repository, but its recommended to have a basic set of sensors and actuators for testing (e.g., LEDs, buttons, temperature sensors).
